## Data Processing

```{r}
library(summarytools)
library(dplyr)
library("ggplot2")                     
library("GGally")
car <- read.csv("CarInsurance.csv")
```

A descriptive table about the variables within the dataset:
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vartabcw2.png")
```

Rename the variables:

```{r}
Gender <- factor(car$Gender)
Vehicle_Make_Region <- factor(car$Vehicle_Make_Region)
Vehicle_Age <- factor(car$Vehicle_Age)
Claim_Amount_Indicator <- factor(car$Claim_Amount_Indicator)

Age <- car$Age
Engine_Capacity <- car$Engine_Capacity
Car_Value <- car$Car_Value
Claim_Amount <- car$Claim_Amount

cont <- car %>% dplyr::select(Age, Engine_Capacity, Car_Value, Claim_Amount)
cat <- car %>% dplyr::select(Gender, Vehicle_Make_Region, Vehicle_Age, Claim_Amount_Indicator)
```

## Q1: Exploratory Data Analysis

We observe the relationship between each variable and Claim_Amount.

### Continuous variable (Age, Engine_Capacity, Car_Value)

Summary statistics

```{r}
summary(cont)
```

Scatterplots: Relationship with Claim_Amount

```{r}
ggpairs(cont)+theme_bw()
```

**Interpretation**

Claimant's age has nearly no correlation to claim amount, implying that
age does not affect claim amount. Car engine capacity and car value have
a weak positive relationship to claim amount, indicating that claim
amount may increase as engine capacity and car value increase. However,
we must note that claim amount, claimant's age, car engine capacity and
car value all have right-skewed distributions. Claim amount has the most
obvious high influential points, ie. there are a few exceptionally high
claim amount cases in the sample, this is especially obvious with the
large difference between maximum claim amount and the 3rd quartile.
Therefore the significance of the difference between claim amount and
these continuous variables must be further investigated.

### Categorical variables (Gender, Vehicle_Make_Region, Vehicle_Age, Claim_Amount_Indicator)

Summary statistics

```{r}
freq(cat)
```

Boxplots: Relationship with Claim_Amount

```{r}
library(gridExtra)

p1 <- ggplot(car, aes(x = Gender, y = Claim_Amount, group = Gender)) + 
      geom_boxplot() + 
      labs(title = "Claim Amount by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Claim Amount (RM)") + 
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("Male", "Female"))

p2 <- ggplot(car, aes(x = Vehicle_Make_Region, y = Claim_Amount, 
      group = Vehicle_Make_Region)) + geom_boxplot() + 
      labs(title = "Claim Amount by Vehicle Make Region", 
      x = "Vehicle Make Region", y = "Claim Amount (RM)")

p3 <- ggplot(car, aes(x = Vehicle_Age, y = Claim_Amount, group = Vehicle_Age)) + 
      geom_boxplot() + 
      labs(title = "Claim Amount by Vehicle Age", 
           x = "Vehicle Age (years)", y = "Claim Amount (RM)")

p4 <- ggplot(car, aes(x = Claim_Amount_Indicator, y = Claim_Amount, 
      group = Claim_Amount_Indicator)) + geom_boxplot() + 
      labs(title = "Claim Amount by Claim Amount Indicator", 
      x = "Claim Amount Indicator", y = "Claim Amount (RM)") +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("Low Claim", "High Claim"))


grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2, heights=c(4, 4))
```

**Interpretation**

Due to the right-skewed nature of claim amount, the median and quartiles
concentrate at the lower end of claim amount for all variables, ie.
boxes with long right whiskers.

We observe no significance between claim amount and claimant's gender
due to the overlapping boxes, though the claim amount influential points
are higher among male claimants, ie. among those exceptionally high
claim cases, most of them are from male claimants. This implies that
gender does not affect claim pricing.

We observe no significance between claim amount and vehicle make region
due to the overlapping boxes, though the claim amount influential points
are higher among european cars, followed by east asia and local, ie.
among those exceptionally high claim cases, most of them are from
european cars. This implies that vehicle make region does not affect
claim pricing.

Since vehicle age is an ordinal variable, we observe that claim amount
seems to decrease as vehicle age increases. However, the significance of
the interpretation must be further investigated as we have more newer
cars within the sample.

```{r}
lowclaim_data <- subset(car, Claim_Amount_Indicator == 0)
highclaim_data <- subset(car, Claim_Amount_Indicator == 1)
summary(lowclaim_data$Claim_Amount)
summary(highclaim_data$Claim_Amount)
```

We observe a clear distinction between low claim indicator and high
claim indicator from the boxplot. The cut-off price that the insurance
company is using seems to be roughly RM 2500 - RM2600.

## Q2: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

```{r}
library(CCA)

car$Female <- car$Gender
car$Vehicle_Make_Region <- ifelse(car$Vehicle_Make_Region %in% 
                           c("EUROPE", "EAST ASIA"), "Foreign", "Local")
car$Foreign <- ifelse(car$Vehicle_Make_Region == "Foreign", 1, 0)
X1 = car %>% dplyr::select(Female, Age)  %>%as.matrix # policy holders
Y1 = car %>% dplyr::select(Foreign, Engine_Capacity, Vehicle_Age, Car_Value) %>% 
     as.matrix # vehicle attributes

cca <- cc(X1,Y1)
cca$cor # first and second canonical correlation
cca$scores$corr.Y.xscores # blue
cca$scores$corr.X.xscores # red
```

```{r}
plt.cc(cca, type="v")
plt.cc(cca, var.label=TRUE, type="v")
```

**Interpretation**

The canonical correlations of the CCA provides information on the
relationship between the Y variables (vehicle attributes) and the X
variables (insurance policy holder information). The first canonical
correlation (0.2532) indicates a moderate positive relationship between
the two sets of variables. The second canonical correlation (0.0631)
indicates an extremely weak positive relationship and may be negligible.

The variable plot and the matrix of correlations between the Y variables
and the first two CC scores (ie. canonical variables) show that:

-   The first CC score has a moderate negative correlation with the all
    original variables, ie. Foreign, Engine_Capacity, Vehicle_Age, and
    Car_Value, with Engine_Capacity being the most negative. We observe
    that the blue coordinates that represent the Y variables lie on the
    negative region of dimension one, within the smaller circle
    representing correlation within -0.5 to 0 . This suggests that a
    high negative first CC score represents a policy holder with a
    vehicle of foreign car makes, higher engine capacities, older
    vehicles and higher car value. The policy holder most likely has a
    vehicle of high engine capacity because it is the most dominating
    factor.

-   The second CC score is most positively correlated with Car_Value,
    followed by Vehicle_Age and Foreign. This suggests that a high
    positive second CC score represents a policy holder with a vehicle
    of high value, old age and foreign car make. However, since the blue
    coordinates are close to 0 on dimension 2, we can consider to
    neglect this interpretation.

In conclusion, the CCA suggests that there is a moderate positive
relationship between policy holder information and vehicle attributes. A
high negative first CC score appears to capture a high risk profile,
while the second CC score is primarily related to car value but
insignificant.

## Q3: Hypothesis Testing

### **Hotelling's two samples, unpaired case**

i\. We are interested to know whether claim amount and car value have
significant difference among male and female claimants. To initialise
this investigation, we log transform these two variables and check that
they follow a normal distribution.

```{r}
library(ICSNP) 
car$Claim_Amount_log <- log(Claim_Amount)
car$Car_Value_log <- log(Car_Value)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(car$Claim_Amount_log, freq = FALSE, xlab = "log(Claim_Amount)", 
     main = "Histogram of log(Claim_Amount)")
lines(density(car$Claim_Amount_log), col=2)
hist(car$Car_Value_log, freq = FALSE, xlab = "log(Car_Value)", 
     main = "Histogram of log(Car_Value)")
lines(density(car$Car_Value_log), col=2)
```

log(Claim_Amount) and log(Car_Value) follow a normal distribution. Then,
compute their respective means.

```{r}
X1 <- car %>% dplyr::filter(Female==1) %>% dplyr::select(Claim_Amount_log, Car_Value_log)
X2 <- car %>% dplyr::filter(Female==0) %>% dplyr::select(Claim_Amount_log, Car_Value_log) 

colMeans(X1)
colMeans(X2)
```

We observe that both males and females might share similar mean log
claim amount and mean log car value. To investigate the significance in
mean differences, we select Hotelling's two sample T2-test, unpaired
case as the multivariate hypothesis test because:

1\. We are comparing two independent groups (male and female).

2\. log claim amount and log car value follow a multivariate normal
distribution.

3\. We make the assumption that the covariance matrices for both groups
are the same.

```{r}
HotellingsT2(X1, X2)
```

The p-value of 0.03948 is less than the significance level of 0.05,
indicating that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis and
conclude that there is a significant difference between males and
females regarding the mean log claim amount and mean log car value. This
concludes that male and female claimants have a different claim amount
and car value on average.\

ii\. We are interested to know whether claim amount and car value have
significant difference among local and foreign car makes. Similar to
(a), we use the log transformed values.

```{r}
Y1 <- car %>% dplyr::filter(Foreign==1) %>% dplyr::select(Claim_Amount_log, Car_Value_log)
Y2 <- car %>% dplyr::filter(Foreign==0) %>% dplyr::select(Claim_Amount_log, Car_Value_log)

colMeans(Y1)
colMeans(Y2)
```

We observe that both foreign and local car makes seem to have distinct
mean log claim amount and mean log car value. To investigate the
significance in mean differences, we select Hotelling's two sample
T2-test, unpaired case as the multivariate hypothesis test because:

1\. We are comparing two independent groups (foreign and local).

2\. log claim amount and log car value follow a multivariate normal
distribution.

3\. We make the assumption that the covariance matrices for both groups
are the same.

```{r}
HotellingsT2(Y1, Y2)
```

The p-value of approximately 0 is less than the significance level of
0.05, indicating that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis
and conclude that there is a significant difference between foreign and
local car makes regarding the mean log claim amount and mean log car
value. This concludes that foreign and local car makes have a different
claim amount and car value on average.

### **Check Assumption**

Hotelling T2-test for 2 samples (unpaired case) requires the assumption
that covariance matrices for both groups are the same.

For (i), we check if the assumption is reasonable by computing the
sample covariances for log(Claim_Amount) and log(Car_Value) for the two
groups: male and female.

```{r}
print("For Female:")
cov(X1)
print("For Male:")
cov(X2)
```

For the female group, the covariance between log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) is 0.0911, while the variances of log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) are 0.8613 and 0.2952, respectively.

For the male group, the covariance between log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) is 0.0909, while the variances of log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) are 0.8279 and 0.3137, respectively.

Since the covariance between log(Claim_Amount) and log(Car_Value) is
very similar for both groups and the variances of log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) are not too different, it is reasonable to assume that
the covariance matrices for both groups are the same.

For (ii), we check if the assumption is reasonable by computing the
sample covariances for log(Claim_Amount) and log(Car_Value) for the two
groups: local and foreign.

```{r}
print("For Foreign: ")
cov(Y1)
print("For Local:")
cov(Y2)
```

For the foreign group, the covariance between log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) is 0.1103, while the variances of log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) are 0.9485 and 0.4330, respectively.

For the local group, the covariance between log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) is 0.0465, while the variances of log(Claim_Amount) and
log(Car_Value) are 0.7769 and 0.1526, respectively.

Since the covariance between log(Claim_Amount) and log(Car_Value) is
very different for both groups and the variances of log(Claim_Amount)
and log(Car_Value) are also very different, it is NOT reasonable to
assume that the covariance matrices for both groups are the same.

## Q4: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

We randomly split the data into test and training sets by 20:80 ratio.

```{r}
library(MASS)
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
train <- sample(nrow(car), nrow(car)*0.8)
train_data <- car[train,]
test_data <- car[-train,]
nrow(train_data)
nrow(test_data)
```

```{r}
# scale/normalise the variables Age, Engine_Capacity, Vehicle_Age, and Car_Value
train_data[, c("Age", "Engine_Capacity", 
          "Vehicle_Age", "Car_Value")] <- scale(train_data[, c("Age", "Engine_Capacity", 
                                                          "Vehicle_Age", "Car_Value")])

# train a LDA classifier (full model) to predict whether a claim is large
car.lda <- lda(Claim_Amount_Indicator ~ Female + Age + Engine_Capacity +
                 Vehicle_Age + Car_Value + Foreign, train_data)

# predict on the test set and calculate the predictive accuracy
test_data[, c("Age", "Engine_Capacity", 
          "Vehicle_Age", "Car_Value")] <- scale(test_data[, c("Age", "Engine_Capacity", 
                                                          "Vehicle_Age", "Car_Value")])
car.pred <- predict(car.lda, test_data)
print(paste("The predictive accuracy is ",
sum(car.pred$class== test_data$Claim_Amount_Indicator)/dim(test_data)[1]*100, "%"))
```

```{r}
table(car.pred$class, test_data$Claim_Amount_Indicator)
```

The classifier correctly predicted low claim for 449 instances and the
high claim for 10 instances, but it falsely predicted the high claim for
188 instances and the low claim for 10 instances.

Since we observed that policy holder age does not affect claim amount,
we carried out this additional step which will aid our discussion for
verification.

```{r}
# train a LDA classifier (full model) to predict whether a claim is large
car.lda2 <- lda(Claim_Amount_Indicator ~ Female + Engine_Capacity + 
                  Vehicle_Age + Car_Value + Foreign, data = train_data)

# predict on the test set and calculate the predictive accuracy
car.pred2 <- predict(car.lda2, test_data)
print(paste("The predictive accuracy is ",
sum(car.pred2$class== test_data$Claim_Amount_Indicator)/dim(test_data)[1]*100, "%"))
```

## Q5: Discussion

### **Advice to insurance company: How might you use our analysis for insurance products pricing?** 

As consultants for your car insurance company, we are pleased to present
the findings of our recent data analysis on your historical claims data.
With Malaysia's Liberalisation of Motor Tariff on 1 July 2017, the
insurance industry is now free to charge policyholders premiums based on
risk profiles. This presents an exciting opportunity for your company to
adopt a more sophisticated approach to pricing insurance products that
reflects the risks of individual policyholders. By utilising the
insights generated from our analysis for your product pricing
strategies, your company can gain a competitive edge by pricing
insurance policies more accurately and ultimately reducing the risk of
financial loss.

In this report, we will discuss three topics:

1\. Factors associated with claim amount

2\. Risk profile formation strategies

3\. Recommendations for product pricing

**Factors associated with claim amount**

In terms of policy holder attribute, we observed that age does not have
an effect on claim amount. Though gender also has a similar outcome due
to the similarity in the middle 50% of the claim amount, we observe that
there are some exceptionally high claim amounts among male policy
holders. We further analysed the significance of gender by investigating
its effect on claim amount and car value collectively. We concluded that
male and female policy holders have distinct claim amount and car value
on average. In terms of vehicle attribute, we observe that engine
capacity has the strongest positive relationship with claim amount,
followed by car value. Vehicle car make does not seem to have a
significant effect on claim amount but we observe some exceptionally
high claim cases among european cars, followed by east asian then local
cars. The claim amount also decreases as vehicle age increases. In terms
of your company's current insurance policy, we discovered that your
company classifies claim amount lower than approximately the range of RM
2500 - RM 2600 as low claim and the otherwise as high claim. In the
subsequent sections, we will provide some recommendations to improve
your current insurance policy.

**Risk profile formation strategies**

Based on a correlation analysis, we discovered a moderate positive
relationship between vehicle attributes and policy holders attributes.
We concluded that it is appropriate to categorise a high risk profile as
policy holders who owns a vehicle of high engine capacity, foreign make,
high car value and old age. These attributes are ordered from the most
dominant to the least. This analysis aligns with our intuition that
policy holder who drives a car with high engine capacity tends to speed
as the car has higher power and acceleration, which can lead to more
severe accidents. On the other hand, foreign make vehicles may require
expensive spare parts and specialised mechanics, increasing repair
costs. High car value vehicles may have more expensive parts and labour
costs for repairs and older vehicles may have more wear and tear,
increasing the likelihood of breakdowns and accidents.

**Recommendations for product pricing**

Based on our findings above, we relabelled 657 policy holders' claim
data into high claim or low claim, taking into consideration policy
holders' gender, age, car engine capacity, car age, car value and car
make. We compared our new labels to your company's actual label and
discovered that only 69.86% of our labels matched. To be specific, we
have labelled 188 cases as high claim when the actual label from your
company is low claim. Since we have concluded that policy holders' age
is not a significant factor, we repeated our analysis while excluding
age and arrived at a similar accuracy score of 69.56%. Both of these
results imply that policyholders with certain high-risk characteristics
have had significantly higher claim amounts. This suggests that your
company may have been charging lower premiums than you should for these
high-risk policyholders, which may lead to potential financial losses
for your company in the future. Therefore, we recommend that your
company adjusts premium rates by taking into consideration policy
holders' gender, car engine capacity, car age, car value and car make to
accurately reflect the risk associated with each policy holders'
profiles.

With our analysis, we hope your company can leverage the benefits of
adopting a risk profiling approach to adjusting premium rates and
embrace it as a key component of your product pricing strategy. However,
our analysis consists of three limitations which we will discuss in the
next section.

### Limitations of our analysis

**Uneven distribution of data**

-   Gender : The gender distribution in the dataset is imbalanced, with
    male policyholders being more than double the number of female
    policyholders.

-   Vehicle Make Region : The distribution of vehicles across different
    regions is uneven, with local vehicles being over nine times more
    frequent than European and East Asian vehicles combined.
    Furthermore, our analysis has combined European and East Asian
    vehicles together, which may have masked some important information
    on their respective significance on claim amount.

-   Vehicle Age : The sample size decreases as vehicle age increases,
    with a large drop in sample size in between the following age
    categories: 0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-15 years, and 16-20 years.

-   Age, Engine_Capacity, Car_Value, and Claim_Amount are all
    right-skewed, meaning that we have more claim data available for
    young policyholders, low engine capacity, low car value, and low
    claim amount.

Therefore, this limitation may affect the accuracy of our analysis in
determining the impact of factors above on claim amount.

**Presence of outliers**

Claim amount may contain outliers because there is a large difference
between the maximum claim amount and claim amount at the 75% point of
the claim data. Therefore, further investigation is needed to confirm if
they are outliers or exceptionally high claim amounts.

**Lack of variables**

We have only worked with six predictors (ie. Female, Age, Engine
Capacity, Vehicle Age, Car Value, Car Make) but there are many more
predictors that can contribute to risk profiling, such as:

-   Driving experience: number of years the driver has been holding a
    driving license and not the actual driving experience.

-   Nature of occupation: determined by whether your job is based indoor
    or outdoor. For example, sales job is considered mostly outdoor and
    it will have a higher rate.

-   No claim discount (NCD): Each private car owner is entitled to NCD
    ranging from 25% to 55% as provided in their individual policy. The
    maximum NCD offered currently is at 55%.

-   Type of car: This refers to the vehicle type such as saloon, MPV,
    SUV or 4-wheel drive. Some company charges differently depending on
    the car type.

-   Type of engine: It's important to know that most car insurance
    company impose higher car insurance premium on cars with turbo
    engine. Some insurers even reject cars with turbo engines.

-   Driver's claims record: A driver who is constantly involved/causing
    accidents and making insurance claims, is obviously a high risk case
    and will have to endure a higher premium.

Hence, your company is encouraged to collect or provide more data to us
to improve the accuracy of our analysis.
